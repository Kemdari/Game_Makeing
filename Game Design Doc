---Daytime
  Right now we're thinking you have to pay off a debt to the hospital, which will get you introduced to the daytime game-mechanics.
  As a vampire in this world you thankfully don't die in the sun however you don't have any powers. as such in the day you don't have access to magic, or regular combat options(?).
in the day you would have to travel via walking (maybe a little parkour) or vehicles. thankfully other creatures of the night won't be out to get you, but that might not mean you are completely safe.

Damage: Blunt, Thrust, Slash, Fire, Magic(?)
