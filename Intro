Inspo Hollow knight

  A Basic area with basic combat, and movement, and currency, and others.

In a world where Magic was thought but a hoax, a necromancer from ancient times reveals itself and goes on a rampage
 you are a Vampire, raised form the dead by the necromancer, however you were raised ages ago when he didn't have  
 full control over a creature as powerfull as a vampire; so you are free to take your revenge/stop the great evil.







Tutorial, you enter the estate of the "long dead" necromancer, trying to navigate a maze of rooms you find a grappling hook, and use it to get up to the balcony overlokking the main floors. 
upon your arrival to the upper floors, you see the gouls who acted as security in the past still fullfilling their role nowaday. this is where you get introduced to the momentum based combat.
at first you are given nothing but a spear and this spear increases in damage and speed the faster you are going, in the early game this can be accomished by grappling hooking an enemy
bring you to them for a power full attack. (this can be improved via move tach allowng you to keep more of that momentum) These weak gouls can't easily harm you however, you can't easily harm them;
making a combat that is unfair unless you use your momentum to deal more damage. you continue dealing with gouls as you xplore the manor, eventually finding the old room he kept his plans in. 
hoping to get to the necromancer before he raises an army nobody can stop you pusue the next area he may be in. but to do so you have to leave through the windowbecause, something is chasaing you. 
after you make your dramatic exit you quikly have to find cover in the woods.
