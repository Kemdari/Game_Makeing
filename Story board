  scheming to kill your master

---Tutorial
   you rush into the manor after learning your friend went and tried to kill the master already. however you have been labled a traitor meaning you have to fight through the gaurds to come to your friends rescue. (this will inculed using your grapling hook to traverse terrain)
upon making it your your masters lair under the mmanor you witness your friend being thrown and beaten by your masters summons, as your master would need a stake to immediatly kill him. you come in interupt the beatdown, and fight thr master yourself
#the fight is rather vague but seeing as he commands you he would be a porwerfull being, capable of dealing a lot of damage and protecting himself.
#I think it would be Cool to have him summon creatures you would have to Kill/ avoid to get to him where he's more or less a sitting duck.
#the Final boss might be your friend wielding vampiric powers, and the magic of your old master.
Defeating the master (how do you nonlethaly stop a mage) you go to help your friend, but instead of accepting your help he decides to execute your master.
and before you can even berate him for it the manor self destructs. you barley survive the explosion, and are saved by paramedics who take you to a hospital.
