---Tutorial
  you enter the estate you used to live in to find some clues, trying to navigate a maze of rooms you grab a backup grappling hook and a stake spear, and use it to get up to the balcony overlokking the main floors. 
upon your arrival to the upper floors you see the gouls who act as security. this is where you get introduced to the momentum based combat.
at first you are given nothing but a spear and this spear increases in damage and speed the faster you are going forward, in the early game this can be accomished by grappling hooking an enemy
bring you to them for a powerfull attack. (this can be improved via move tach allowng you to keep more of that momentum) These weak gouls can't easily harm you however, you can't easily harm them;
making a combat that is unfair unless you use your momentum to deal more damage. you continue dealing with gouls as you explore the manor, eventually finding the room where your master died.
there you find some old plans with missing documents so you have to try and piece together the Plan that your friend seems to have stolen. 
hoping to get to your friend before he raises an army nobody can stop you pursue him to the next area he may be in. Thankfully you can us the teleporter your master made to immediatly go to the general area.
